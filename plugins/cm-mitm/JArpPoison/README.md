#JArpPoison

JArpPoison is an open source project which does arp poisoning and based on that performs two types of attacks:
	1) Network jamming(denial of service in a local network's hosts)
	2) Man in the middle attack between the router and a host(user chooses the victim)

The network jamming is done by the JNetJammer class and the MITM(Man in the middle) is done by the JMITM class.
REMEMBER in order to run these classes you need to be root, download the src/ and compile them

Check the --help of the JNetJammer and MITM to learn about the command line arguments of the classes

#JMITM and Wireshark
You can perform live packet analysis on the captured packets from the MITM attack(by default the captured are saved in a local file for offline analysis)
using wireshark

first make a fifo file:

	mkfifo /tmp/myfifo

then start your JMITM and tell it to redirect its output to the fifo file:

	sudo java JMITM --output /tmp/myfifo

finally start wireshark and tell to read from the fifo file:

	wireshark -k -i /tmp/myfifo



#Dependencies

In order to properly compile and run the JArpPoison you need to install jpcap:
