# [Canis Major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canis_Major) - An Execution Manager for wicked command line tools.

To start with, this will concentrate on giving an interactive view to the famous wicked nmap
and then more fun activities that can be performed with it such as exploring
vulnerabilities on the scanned network nodes, which can be done by integrating wicked libraries/tools
such as [JArpPoison](https://github.com/alamages/JArpPoison) and/or the mighty [dsniff](https://github.com/tecknicaltom/dsniff)
into this project.

This application is based on the Eclipse RCP, why? see the [WIKI](https://github.com/leaobr/CanisMajor/wiki/Why-Eclipse-RCP-application%3F).
However, the long term goals include a command line and a web interface.

To get started see the [development setup](https://github.com/leaobr/CanisMajor/wiki).

Please see the current open [issues](https://github.com/leaobr/CanisMajor/issues) before testing the application.


_NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS AT VERY EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT! It doesn't do or show anything very exciting at the moment but a simple nmap scan nodes tree in a RCP GUI._
