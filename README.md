### Canis Major - An Execution Manager for wicked command line tools.

To start with this will concentrate on giving an interactive view to the famous wicked nmap
and then more fun activities that can be performed with it such as exploring
vulnerabilities on the scanned network nodes.

This application is based on the Eclipse RCP, but why? see the [WIKI](https://github.com/leaobr/CanisMajor/wiki/Why-Eclipse-RCP-application%3F).
However, the long term goals include a command line and a web interface.

To get started see [development setup](https://github.com/leaobr/CanisMajor/wiki).

Please see the current open [issues](https://github.com/leaobr/CanisMajor/issues) before testing the application.

Enjoy!
